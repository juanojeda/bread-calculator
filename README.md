# Bread Calculator Readme

This app will be a simple calculator to calculate bakers' percentages in your recipe.

## What? Why?
Baking recipes are often written in percentages, but the way they work can be confusing if you don't know about them. But once you know the trick, they're actually quite simple.

Here's the trick: Take the total amount of flour - this will be 100%. From there, all other ingredients are measured as a percentage of baker's flour.

For example, in this recipe:

```
- Plain flour     500g  51.55%
- Baker's flour   250g  25.77%
- Rye flour       130g  13.40%
- Spelt flour     90g   09.29%
- Water           750g  77.32%
- Levain          235g  24.23%
- Salt            18g   01.86%
```

In this recipe, the combined weight of the plain, baker's, rye and spelt flours is 970g.
Thus, all the weights can be measured as percentages of that combined weight.

## Ok, but why?
Baker's percentages allow you to scale your recipe as necessary. For instance, if you have less than the required amount of plain flour, or you want to make a bulk batch, you can easily scale the rest of the recipe accordingly.
